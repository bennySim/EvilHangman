# EvilHangman
The classic Hangman game. At least the player thinks so. At the beginning, the length of the word is chosen randomly and then the 
word is adjusted according to how the player guesses, in such a way that game maintains a list of all given words,
then continuously pares down the word list to try to dodge the player's guesses as much as possible.
